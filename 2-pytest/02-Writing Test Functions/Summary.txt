ğŸ‘‰ The sample code should be downloaded into /path/to/code.

ğŸ‘‰ The Cards application (and pytest) is installed into a virtual environment with the following steps:

    cd /path/to/code
    python -m venv venv --prompt cards
    source venv/bin/activate (or venv\Scripts\activate.bat on Windows)
    pip install ./cards_proj
    pip install pytest

ğŸ‘‰ pytest uses assert rewriting, which allows us to use standard Python assert expressions.

ğŸ‘‰ Tests can fail from assertion failures, from calls to pytest.fail(), or from any uncaught exception.

ğŸ‘‰ pytest.raises() is used to test for expected exceptions.

ğŸ‘‰ A great way to structure tests is called Given-When-Then or Arrange-Act-Assert.

ğŸ‘‰ Classes can be used to group tests.

ğŸ‘‰ Running small subsets of tests is handy while debugging, 
and pytest allows you to run a small batch of tests in many ways.

ğŸ‘‰ The -vv command-line flag shows even more information during test failures.
