You can have pytest settings in one primary configuration file per project: pytest.ini, pyproject.toml, tox.ini, or setup.cfg.

pytest calls the primary configuration file location the root directory or rootdir.

Settings live in the configuration file, including options and flags defined by the addopts configuration setting.

The conftest.py file is used for fixtures and hook functions shared by all tests in the same directory or lower.

The __init__.py files in test subdirectories allow you to duplicate test file names.
