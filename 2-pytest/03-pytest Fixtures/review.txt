ğŸ‘‰ Fixtures are @pytest.fixture() decorated functions.
ğŸ‘‰ Test functions or other fixtures depend on a fixture by putting its name in their parameter list.
ğŸ‘‰ Fixtures can return data using return or yield.
ğŸ‘‰ Code before the yield is the setup code. Code after the yield is the teardown code.
ğŸ‘‰ Fixtures can be set to function, class, module, package, or session scope. 
ğŸ‘‰ The default is function scope. 
ğŸ‘‰ You can even define the scope dynamically.
ğŸ‘‰ Multiple test functions can use the same fixture.
ğŸ‘‰ Multiple test modules can use the same fixture if itâ€™s in a conftest.py file
ğŸ‘‰ Multiple fixtures at different scope can speed up test suites while maintaining test isolation.
ğŸ‘‰ Tests and fixtures can use multiple fixtures.
ğŸ‘‰ Autouse fixtures donâ€™t have to be named by the test function.
ğŸ‘‰ You can have the name of a fixture be different than the fixture function name.
