ðŸ‘‰ pytest is installed into a virtual environment with the following steps:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (or venv\Scripts\activate.bat/venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 on Windows)
pip install pytest

ðŸ‘‰ pytest can be run in several different ways:

pytest: With no arguments, pytest searches the local directory and subdirectories for tests.
pytest <filename>: Runs the tests in one file
pytest <filename> <filename> ...: Runs the tests in multiple named files
pytest <dirname>: Starts in a particular directory (or more than one) and recursively searches for tests


ðŸ‘‰ Test discovery refers to how pytest finds your test code and depends on naming:

Test files should be named test_<something>.py or <something>_test.py.
Test methods and functions should be named test_<something>.
Test classes should be named Test<Something>.

ðŸ‘‰ The possible outcomes of a test function include: PASSED (.), FAILED (F), SKIPPED (s), XFAIL (x), XPASS (X), and ERROR (E).
ðŸ‘‰ The -v or --verbose command-line flag is used to reveal more verbose output.
ðŸ‘‰ The --tb=no command-line flag is used to to turn off tracebacks.
