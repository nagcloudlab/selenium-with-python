pytest --cov=cards <test path> to run with a simple report

pytest --cov=cards --cov-report=term-missing <test path> to show which lines weren’t run

pytest --cov=cards --cov-report=html <test path> to generate an HTML report

For running coverage by itself, use:

coverage run --source=cards -m pytest <test path> to run the test suite with coverage
coverage report to show a simple terminal report
coverage report --show-missing to show which lines weren’t run
coverage html to generate an HTML report
Even if you ran coverage from pytest --cov=..., you can run different reports or generate HTML using coverage report and coverage html.

The --cov and --source flags tell coverage what code to watch, and can either be the name of an installed package, or the path to the application code.
